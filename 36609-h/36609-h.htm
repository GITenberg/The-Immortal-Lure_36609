<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Scene</span>: <i>A work-room of</i> <span class="smcap">Giorgione</span> <i>on the edge of the Lagoon in which
lie the Campo Santo and Murano. It is littered with brushes, canvases,
casts, etc., and its walls are frescoed indiscriminately with saints and
bacchantes, satyrs and Madonnas, on backgrounds religious or woodland. A
door is on the right back; and foliate Gothic windows, in the rear,
reveal the magic water with its gliding gondolas. On a support toward
the centre of the room is a picture&mdash;covered, and not far from it, a
couch.</i></p>

<p><i>Late Afternoon.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Giorgione</span>, <i>who has been sitting anguished on the couch, rises with
determined bitterness. As he does so,</i> <span class="smcap">Bellini</span> <i>enters anxiously.</i></p>

<i>Bellini.</i> Giorgione!<br />
<br />
<i>Giorgione</i> (<i>turning</i>). It is you?<br />
<br />
<i>Bellini.</i><span style="margin-left: 4em;">Your word came to me,</span><br />
In San Lazzario where I labored late,<br />
And shakes my troubled heart. You will not do this!<br />
<br />
<i>Giorgione.</i> Yes!<br />
<br />
<i>Bellini.</i><span style="margin-left: 4em;">How my son! her picture! as a wanton's!</span><br />
<br />
<i>Giorgione.</i> Tho it has been till now my adoration!<br />
The fairest of my dreams and the most holy!<br />
Yes, by the virtue of all honest women,<br />
If such there be in Venice,<br />
I swear it shall be borne by ribald hands<br />
Thro the very streets.<br />
<br />
<i>Bellini.</i><span style="margin-left: 6em;">My son!</span><br />
<br />
<i>Giorgione.</i><span style="margin-left: 8em;">A public thing!</span></p>

<p class="right">[<i>Points to picture.</i></p>

<p>
Fit for the most lascivious! who now<br />
Shall gaze on what I had beheld alone,<br />
On what was purer to me than the Virgin!<br />
The very pimps and panders of the Piazza<br />
Shall if they will whet appetite upon it,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span><br />
And smack their losel lips.<br />
<br />
<i>Bellini.</i><span style="margin-left: 8em;">And to what end?</span><br />
<br />
<i>Giorgione.</i> Her shame!<br />
<br />
<i>Bellini.</i><span style="margin-left: 7em;">The deeds of wounded pride and love</span><br />
Work not so, but fall back upon the doer&mdash;<br />
Or on some other.<br />
<br />
<i>Giorgione.</i><span style="margin-left: 3em;">I care not!</span><br />
<br />
<i>Bellini.</i><span style="margin-left: 9em;">Nor have,</span><br />
Ever, to heed me! as Aretino,<br />
Who turns your praise to Titian, has told.<br />
For your wild will runs ever without curb,<br />
And I who reared you, as my very own,<br />
Must pay the fall.<br />
<br />
<i>Giorgione.</i><span style="margin-left: 3em;">No!</span><br />
<br />
<i>Bellini.</i><span style="margin-left: 6em;">And the piety</span><br />
I would have won you to in the past days<br />
Is wasted. The Madonnas<br />
I painted with a heart inspired of Heaven<br />
You paint with pride.<br />
<br />
<i>Giorgione.</i><span style="margin-left: 5em;">But with all gratitude!</span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span><br />
Ah yes, believe me,<br />
And with a rich remembrance!<br />
For scarce oblivion could wipe from me<br />
How as a wasted lad I came to Venice&mdash;<br />
A miserable, patched and pallid waif,<br />
With but an eye to see and hand to shape!<br />
You took me from the streets and taught me all<br />
The old can teach the young, until my name<br />
Is high in Venice&mdash;<br />
Linked with that of Beauty&mdash;<br />
"Giorgione! our Giorgione!" do they cry<br />
On the canals, the very gondoliers.<br />
And in a little while it should have glowed<br />
Immortal on the breast of Italy,<br />
As does Apelles on the page of Greece,<br />
For I was half-divine, until&mdash;&mdash;<br />
<br />
<i>Bellini.</i><span style="margin-left: 10em;">Until</span><br />
A girl whom you had fixed your heart upon<br />
With boundless folly, you who should have lived<br />
With but one passion&mdash;that of brain and brush&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span><br />
Until she&mdash;&mdash;<br />
<br />
<i>Giorgione.</i> Say it!<br />
<br />
<i>Bellini.</i><span style="margin-left: 5em;">This Isotta&mdash;&mdash;</span><br />
<br />
<i>Giorgione.</i><span style="margin-left: 10em;">Ai!</span><br />
Whom I had chosen o'er a hundred others<br />
To soar with!<br />
To soar and then in wedded peace to prize!<br />
This false Isotta<br />
Whom in poverty<br />
I found, as you found me, and loved to madness.<br />
This fair Isotta<br />
Whom I would have made<br />
All Venice to be a halo for&mdash;as were<br />
Cities of old for queens of sceptred love:<br />
Until she leaves, departs, forsakes me, goes<br />
Away, worthless away, from my true arms,<br />
With Luzzi, a lank boy.<br />
<br />
<i>Bellini.</i><span style="margin-left: 3em;">So. And most strange.</span><br />
<br />
<i>Giorgione.</i> No, nothing a woman does is ever strange!<br />
Will they not cloak a lie in innocence,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span><br />
A treachery in veiling soft caresses&mdash;<br />
Tho to the Mass unceasingly they fare<br />
And say like her their aves night and noon?<br />
Have they a want that wantons not with guile,<br />
A tear that is not turgid with deceit?<br />
Are not their passions blown by every wind?<br />
Have they not all the straying heart of Helen?<br />
Then why must I,<br />
Who had in me a hope<br />
That rivalled Raphael's or Leonardo's,<br />
Keep, cozened so, that I contemn her shame?<br />
<br />
<i>Bellini.</i> Because she is a woman&mdash;whom you tempted,<br />
Tho with all trust to wed her&mdash;and you know not<br />
Whether her going was of shamelessness.<br />
<br />
<i>Giorgione</i> (<i>laughing bitterly</i>). Or whether she may not yet return, today,<br />
And with a heart that is a nymph's, a soul<br />
That is a nun's,<br />
Beguile me back to doting?<br />
Whether she may not&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span><br />
With that body God<br />
Might once, deceived, have moulded angels after&mdash;?<br />
Then flaunt her thralling of me to the world,<br />
Whose ready lips should laugh where'er we went<br />
And whisper, "Isotta, there! Giorgione's mistress!<br />
Who makes a mocking of him?"<br />
<br />
<i>Bellini.</i><span style="margin-left: 10em;">Never! never!</span><br />
Only your unrelenting brain would think it.<br />
For this I know of her, that tho she has<br />
Deserted you for what must seem to be<br />
Only a new-found passion&mdash;<br />
Yet is she womanly, and did you give her,<br />
As now you mean, to avid lusting eyes,<br />
Life would be smitten from her.<br />
<br />
<i>Giorgione.</i><span style="margin-left: 9em;">As it should!</span><br />
<br />
<i>Bellini.</i> And then from you, repentant of her fate?<br />
No, no, my son, I have not seen you rise,<br />
A planet from the sea, the world's first painter,<br />
To set in this:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span><br />
You owe my fathering more.<br />
And listen, I have brought to you a way<br />
Of laurels for forgetting. I have come<br />
With a commission from the Signoria,</p>

<p class="right">[<i>Takes it from his breast.</i></p>

<p>
Which names you the chief glory of this city<br />
And votes you proud permission to adorn<br />
San Marco's highest altar with perfection.<br />
<br />
<i>Giorgione.</i> And which I spurn, an insult in its pity!
</p>

<p class="right">[<i>Flings it from him.</i></p>

<p>
As they shall learn&mdash;these silk and velvet Signors,<br />
Whose condescending ducats buy the dreams<br />
Of the immortal!<br />
Or no!... I meant not that&mdash;to wound a kindness.<br />
<br />
<i>Bellini.</i> Your ways have ever been the ways of wounding.<br />
<br />
<i>Giorgione.</i> And to the end must be. (<i>Brokenly</i>)<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>For now my hand<br />
Is palsied! I can never paint again.<br />
Colour and shaping light turn in my soul<br />
To chaos and to blindness&mdash;to despair!<br />
The brush I lift, to sterile pain more loth!<br />
I yearn and impotence alone arises.<br />
That picture has dried beauty's vein within me<br />
And left me ... Ah!... She shall atone it! (<i>calls</i>) Gigia!<br />
Shameless she is and shall be seen it!&mdash;Gigia!&mdash;</p>

<p class="right">[<i>Bitterly.</i></p>

<p>
Aretino, who is the tongue of lewdness,<br />
And Titian, who trips to it, may gloat,</p>

<p class="right">[<span class="smcap">Gigia</span> <i>hobbles in.</i></p>

<p>
But they&mdash;&mdash;<br />
<br />

<br />
<i>Gigia.</i> <span style="margin-left: 6em;">How can I tell you, if I may</span><br />
Not speak? And you should hear.... (<i>Crossing herself</i>) It is the plague.<br />
A whisper is about<br />
That it has broken out at last in Venice.</p>

<p class="blockquot">[<span class="smcap">Giorgione</span> <i>staring at her, trembles and seems slowly
stricken&mdash;while his eyes fill as with some evil irrecoverable

<p>

<br />
<i>Giorgione.</i><span style="margin-left: 3em;"> Oh!... and yet ... nothing ... a dream</span><br />
That came to me last night&mdash;as if from death.<br />
<br />
<i>Bellini.</i> Then, O my son, it is a premonition,<br />
A pall against this purpose! that you may<br />
Not let these ribald two&mdash;<br />
Aretino, this poet and depraver,<br />
And Titian snared within his pagan senses,<br />
Enter and gaze upon.... O boy, you will not!<br />
Despoil the picture,<br />
Scatter it to the seas,<br />
And vow never again to paint another,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span><br />
Tho that would break my heart, but promise me&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquot">[<i>A knocking interrupts, and a voice without calls lustily</i>:</p>

(<i>Begins</i>)&mdash;A wench I had,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4.4em;">But where is she&mdash;?</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 10em;">A-ho!</span><br />
Old Gigia, is it? Then we come apace,</p>

<p class="right">[<i>Enters leeringly with</i> <span class="smcap">Titian</span>.</p>

<p>Like satyrs to the piping of Adonis!</p>

<p class="right">[<i>With irony.</i></p>

But, bah! the smell of melancholy! Come,<br />
What is it? The tale is out about the maid?<br />
And therefore tears?</p>

<p class="right">[<i>Laughs.</i></p>

<p>
Well, by the lids of Venus, Giorgio,<br />
It serves you well&mdash;or Eve was not a woman!<br />
There were too many ripe for your assay.<br />
Why, I believe that every damsel's lips<br />
On the lagoons were pinched with longing for you!<br />

Into my eyes.<br />
<br />
<i>Giorgione.</i><span style="margin-left: 5em;">They will no more, Titian.</span><br />
<br />
<i>Aretino.</i> In sooth! for since one wench in all the world<br />

And yet&mdash;to choose this Luzzi,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>This swaddling acolyte of Innocence,<br />

<br />
<i>Giorgione.</i> Stay, let him speak, my master, as he wills.<br />
<br />
<i>Aretino.</i> I say then, Seraph, of your amorosa,<br />
That she deceived me&mdash;<br />
That I thought her dreams<br />
Were chaster than the moon, or by my beard,<br />
Which is not born, I should have tricked her senses<br />
Away from you ... if lies and treachery<br />
And tempting honeyed verses could have done it!<br />
For an Elysium like her warm round body<br />
I never looked upon.<br />
<br />
<i>Bellini.</i><span style="margin-left: 6em;">Aretino!</span><br />
<br />
<i>Giorgione.</i> Peace! he shall speak! for this is what should be.<br />
<br />
<i>Aretino.</i> Ai, Messer Bellini, and your age forgets<br />
That he is well consoled with the dear thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span><br />
That her first joy was his.<br />
<br />
<i>Bellini.</i> <span style="margin-left: 7em;">Ah!...</span><br />
<br />
<i>Aretino.</i><span style="margin-left: 9em;">And that vision&mdash;!</span><br />
Why, I have peeped upon her face, no farther.<br />
But to have seen the beauty he has seen,<br />
The Aphrodite-dream of loveliness,<br />
I would have dared virginity's last door.<br />
<br />
<i>Giorgione.</i> Then you shall see it.<br />
<br />
<i>Bellini.</i><span style="margin-left: 10em;">My son!</span><br />
<br />
<i>Giorgione.</i><span style="margin-left: 12em;">Yes, tho I die!</span><br />

For, pardon, if I say that you sometimes<br />
Have loathed my triumphs.<br />
<br />
<i>Titian.</i><span style="margin-left: 8em;">That is so, Giorgione.</span><br />
But with the brush I yet shall equal them.<br />
<br />
<i>Giorgione.</i> You shall surpass them. For my last is done.<br />
<br />
<i>Titian.</i> Come, do you jest?<br />
<br />
<i>Giorgione.</i><span style="margin-left: 7em;">My last, and it is there!</span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p class="right">[<i>Points to picture.</i></p>

From ear to ear with jest and utter joy&mdash;<br />
You, Titian, a sycophant of Fame,<br />
And you, Aretino, who incarnate lust,<br />

<p>"These poems are flashingly, glowingly full of the East.... What I am
sure of in Mr. Rice is that here we have an American poet whom we may
claim as ours." <i>The North American Review</i> (<i>William Dean Howells</i>).</p>

<p>"Mr. Rice has the gift of leadership, and he is a force with whom we
must reckon." <i>The Boston Transcript.</i></p>

<p>... "We find here a poet who strives to reach the goal which marks the
best that can be done in poetry." <i>The Book News Monthly</i> (<i>A. S.
Henry</i>).</p>

<p>"When you hear the pessimists bewailing the good old time when real
poets were abroad in the land ... do not fail to quote them almost
anything by Cale Young Rice, a real poet writing to-day.... He has done
so much splendid work one can scarcely praise him too highly." <i>The San
Francisco Call.</i></p>

<p>"In 'Many Gods' the scenes are those of the East, and while it is not
the East of Loti, Arnold or Hearn, it is still a place of brooding,
majesty, mystery and subtle fascination. There is a temptation to quote
such verses for their melody, dignity of form, beauty of imagery and
height of inspiration." <i>The Chicago Journal.</i></p>

<p>"'Love's Cynic' (a long poem in the volume) might be by Browning at his
best." <i>Pittsburg Gazette-Times.</i></p>

<p>"This is a serious, and from any standpoint, a successful piece of work
... in it are poems that will become classic." <i>Passaic</i> (<i>New Jersey</i>)
<i>News.</i></p>

<p>"Mr. Rice must be hailed as one among living masters of his art, one to
whom we may look for yet greater things." <i>Presbyterian Advance.</i></p>

<p>"This book is in many respects a remarkable work. The poems are indeed
poems." <i>The Nashville Banner.</i></p>

<p>"Mr. Rice's poetical plays reach a high level of achievement.... But
these poems show a higher vision and surer mastery of expression than
ever before." <i>The London Bookman.</i></p>

<p>"It is as vivid as a page from Browning. Mr. Rice has the dramatic
pulse." <i>James Huneker.</i></p>

<p>"It embraces in small compass all the essentials of the drama." <i>New
York Saturday Times Review</i> (<i>Jessie B. Rittenhouse</i>).</p>

<p>"It presents one of the most striking situations in dramatic literature
and its climax could not be improved." <i>The San Francisco Call.</i></p>

<p>"It has undeniable power, and is a very decided poetic achievement."
<i>The Boston Transcript.</i></p>

<p>"It leaves an enduring impression of a soul tragedy." <i>The Churchman.</i></p>

<p>"Since the publication of his 'Charles di Tocca' and other dramas, Cale
Young Rice has justly been regarded as a leading American master of that
difficult form, and many critics have ranked him above Stephen Phillips,
at least on the dramatic side of his art. And this judgment is further
confirmed by 'A Night in Avignon.' It is almost incredible that in less
than 500 lines Mr. Rice should have been able to create so perfect a
play with so powerful a dramatic effect." <i>The Chicago Record-Herald</i>
(<i>Edwin S. Shuman</i>).</p>

<p>"There is poetic richness in this brilliant composition; a beauty of
sentiment and grace in every line. It is impressive, metrically pleasing
and dramatically powerful." <i>The Philadelphia Record.</i></p>

<p>"It offers one of the most striking situations in dramatic literature."
<i>The Louisville Courier-Journal.</i></p>

<p>"The publication of a poetic drama of the quality of Mr. Rice's is an
important event in the present tendency of American literature. He is a
leader in this most significant movement, and 'A Night in Avignon' is
marked, like his other plays, by dramatic directness, high poetic
fervor, clarity of poetic diction, and felicity of phrasing." <i>The
Chicago Journal.</i></p>

<p>"It is a dramatically told episode, and the metre is most effectively
handled, making a welcome change for blank verse, and greatly enhancing
the interest." <i>Sydney Lee.</i></p>

<p>"Many critics, on hearing Mr. Bryce's prediction that America will one
day have a poet, would be tempted to remind him of Mr. Rice." <i>The
Hartford</i> (<i>Conn.</i>) <i>Courant.</i></p>

<p>Minnie Maddern Fisk says: "No one can doubt that it is superior
poetically and dramatically to Stephen Phillips' work," and that Mr.
Rice ranks with Mr. Phillips at his best has often been reaffirmed.</p>

<p>"It is encouraging to the hope of a native drama to know that an
American has written a play which is at the same time of decided poetic
merit and of decided dramatic power." <i>The New York Times</i> (<i>Charles M.
Hathaway, Jr.</i>).</p>

<p>"The most remarkable quality of the play is its sustained dramatic
strength. Poetically it is frequently of great beauty. It is also lofty
in conception, lucid and felicitous in style, and the dramatic pulse
throbs in every line." <i>The Chicago Record-Herald.</i></p>

<p><i>The Springfield Republican</i> says: "The characters are drawn with force
and the play is dignified and powerful," and adds that if it does not
succeed on the stage it will be "because of its excellence."</p>

<p>"Mr. Rice is one of the few present-day poets who have the steadiness
and weight for a well-sustained drama." <i>The Louisville Post</i>
(<i>Margaret Anderson</i>).</p>

<p>"It has equal command of imagination, dramatic utterance, picturesque
effectiveness and metrical harmony." <i>The London</i> (<i>England</i>) <i>Bookman.</i></p>

<p><i>T. P.'s Weekly</i> says: "It might well stand the difficult test of
production and will be welcomed by all who care for serious verse."</p>

<p><i>The Glasgow</i> (<i>Scotland</i>) <i>Herald</i> says: "Yolanda of Cyprus is finely
constructed; the irregular blank verse admirably adapted for the
exigencies of intense emotion; the characters firmly drawn; and the
climax serves the purpose of good stagecraft and poetic justice."</p>

<p>"It is well constructed and instinct with dramatic power." <i>Sydney Lee.</i></p>

<p>"It is as readable as a novel." <i>The Pittsburg Post.</i></p>

<p>"Here and there an almost Shakespearean note is struck. In makeup,
arrangement, and poetic intensity it ranks with Stephen Phillips' work."

<p>"I take off my hat to Mr. Rice. His play is full of poetry, and the
pitch and dignity of the whole are remarkable." <i>James Lane Allen.</i></p>

<p>"It is a dramatic poem one reads with a heightened sense of its fine
quality throughout. It is sincere, strong, finished and noble, and
sustains its distinction of manner to the end.... The character of
Helena is not unworthy of any of the great masters of dramatic
utterance." <i>The Chicago Tribune.</i></p>

<p>"The drama is one of the best of the kind ever written by an American
author. Its whole tone is masterful, and it must be classed as one of
the really literary works of the season." (1903). <i>The Milwaukee
Sentinel.</i></p>

<p>"It shows a remarkable sense of dramatic construction as well as poetic
power and strong characterization." <i>James MacArthur, in Harper's
Weekly.</i></p>

<p>"This play has many elements of perfection. Its plot is developed with
ease and with a large dramatic force; its characters are drawn with
sympathy and decision; and its thoughts rise to a very real beauty. By
reason of it the writer has gained an assured place among playwrights
who seek to give literary as well as dramatic worth to their plays."
<i>The Richmond</i> (<i>Va.</i>) <i>News-Leader.</i></p>

<p>"The action of the play is admirably compact and coherent, and it
contains tragic situations which will afford pleasure not only to the
student, but to the technical reader." <i>The Nation.</i></p>

<p>"It is the most powerful, vital, and truly tragical drama written by an
American for some years. There is genuine pathos, mighty yet never
repellent passion, great sincerity and penetration, and great elevation
and beauty of language." <i>The Chicago Post.</i></p>

<p>"Mr. Rice ranks among America's choicest poets on account of his power
to turn music into words, his virility, and of the fact that he has
something of his own to say." <i>The Boston Globe.</i></p>

<p>"The whole play breathes forth the indefinable spirit of the Italian
renaissance. In poetic style and dramatic treatment it is a work of
art." <i>The Baltimore Sun.</i></p>

<p>"Mr. Rice has the technical cunning that makes up almost the entire
equipment of many poets nowadays, but human nature is more to him always
... and he has the feeling and imaginative sympathy without which all
poetry is but an empty and vain thing." <i>The London Bookman.</i></p>

<p>"Mr. Rice's note is a clarion call, and of his two poems, 'The Strong
Man to His Sires' and 'The Young to the Old,' the former will send a
thrill to the heart of every man who has the instinct of race in his
blood, while the latter should be printed above the desk of every minor
poet and pessimist.... The sonnets of the sequence, 'Quest and
Requital,' have the elements of great poetry in them." <i>The Glasgow</i>
(<i>Scotland</i>) <i>Herald.</i></p>

<p>"Mr. Rice's poems are singularly free from affectation, and he seems to
have written because of the sincere need of expressing something that
had to take art form." <i>The Sun</i> (<i>New York</i>).</p>

<p>"The ability to write verse that scans is quite common.... But the
inspired thought behind the lines is a different thing; and it is this
thought untrammeled&mdash;the clear vision searching into the deeps of human
emotion&mdash;which gives the verse of Mr. Rice weight and potency.... In the
range of his metrical skill he easily stands with the best of living
craftsmen ... and we have in him ... a poet whose dramas and lyrics will
endure." <i>The Book News Monthly</i> (<i>A. S. Henry</i>).</p>

<p>"These poems are marked by a breadth of outlook, individuality and
beauty of thought. The author reveals deep, sincere feeling on topics
which do not readily lend themselves to artistic expression and which he
makes eminently worth while." <i>The Buffalo</i> (<i>N. Y.</i>) <i>Courier.</i></p>

<p>"We get throughout the idea of a vast universe and of the soul merging
itself in the infinite.... The great poem of the volume, however, is
'The Strong Man to His Sires.'" <i>The Louisville Post</i> (<i>Margaret S.
Anderson</i>).</p>

<p>"The poems possess much music ... and even in the height of intensified
feeling the clearness of Mr. Rice's ideas is not dimmed by the obscure
haze that too often goes with the divine fire." <i>The Boston Globe.</i></p>

<p>"I was greatly impressed with it and derived a sense of personal
encouragement from the evidence of so fine and lofty a product for the
stage." <i>Richard Mansfield.</i></p>

<p>"It is a powerful piece of dramatic portraiture in which Cale Young Rice
has again demonstrated his insight and power. What he did before in
'Charles di Tocca' he has repeated and improved upon.... Not a few
instances of his strength might be cited as of almost Shakespearean
force. Indeed the strictly literary merit of the tragedy is altogether
extraordinary. It is a contribution to the drama full of charm and
power." <i>The Chicago Tribune.</i></p>

<p>"From the standpoint of poetry, dignity of conception, spiritual
elevation and finish and beauty of line, Mr. Rice's 'David' is, perhaps,
superior to his 'Yolanda of Cyprus,' but the two can scarcely be
compared." <i>The New York Times</i> (<i>Jessie B. Rittenhouse</i>).</p>

<p>"Never before has the theme received treatment in a manner so worthy of
it." The <i>St. Louis Globe-Democrat.</i></p>

<p>"It needs but a word, for it has been passed upon and approved by
critics all over the country." <i>Book News Monthly.</i> And again: "But few
recent writers seem to have found the secret of dramatic blank verse;
and of that small number, Mr. Rice is, if not first, at least without
superior."</p>

<p>"With instinctive dramatic and poetic power, Mr. Rice combines a
knowledge of the exigencies of the stage." <i>Harper's Weekly.</i></p>

<p>"It is safe to say that were Mr. Rice an Englishman or a Frenchman, his
reputation as his country's most distinguished poetic dramatist would
have been assured by a more universal sign of recognition." <i>The
Baltimore News</i> (<i>writing of all Mr. Rice's plays</i>).</p>

optimist&mdash;and in these days an optimist is irresistible&mdash;and he can
touch delicately things too holy for a rough or violent pathos." <i>The
London Star</i> (<i>James Douglas</i>).</p>

<p>"Mr. Rice's highest gift is essentially lyrical. His lyrics have a charm
and grace of melody distinctively their own." <i>The London Bookman.</i></p>

<p>"Mr. Rice is keenly responsive to the loveliness of the outside world,
and he reveals this beauty in words that sing themselves." <i>The Boston

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
